    <h1>Two of my Characters!</h1>
    <h2>Newark and Ohare</h2>
    <p>Newark and Ohare are two of my older characters that I created in 2009. They are twin gods
        and considered the leaders of a group of new gods known as the Offsprings. I love them both
        very, very much!

    <h3 class="Newark">Newark - the Normal Force</h3>
    <p>Newark is the god of Normality and his element is Void. Like a cold, unfeeling observer, he maintains
        our sense of what is normal and what is not. He is a man of the status quo, although by his own powers
        he can shape that status quo in any given moment. If Newark tells you something, you will hear it as true
        and not even bat an eyelash.

        Newark's weapon is a shapeshifting disk of pure void known as Discus. Discus often takes the form of an axe for combat.
        The Void element is the anti-element. It is completely resistant to all other elements. It consumes energy rather than creating it.

    <h3 class="Ohare">Ohare - the Chance</h3>
    <p>Ohare is the goddess of Abnormality and her element is Energy. A livewire, Ohare is always bouncing around and filled to the brim
        with cheer and vim! She is an extraordinary person in both a quantifiable and qualitative way. In her presence, unlikely things happen more frequently.
        She's completely unpredictable, which means not even powerful seers can deduce her next move. She's quite loud and forceful.

    <p>Ohare is unique among the Offsprings because she has three different weapons! The first two are a pair of handbells that shoot energy blasts
        like guns, known as Melody and Harmony. Her melee weapon of choice is a bellstick engulfed in flames that she wields like a baseball bat.
        The Energy element is the element of electricity, plasma, stars and solar power. If it has a charge, it is under her domain!
